    "Quantum tunneling is prevalent for electrons across a wide range of tested barrier widths (0.5-5 A) and heights (0.2-2 eV) when classical transmission is forbidden (E < V).",
    "Proton tunneling becomes significant (T_q > 1e-10) for barrier widths up to ~1.5 A at lower barrier heights (e.g., 0.5 eV), and for narrower barriers (<1 A) even at higher barrier heights (e.g., 2 eV).",
    "Deuteron tunneling probabilities are consistently much lower than proton tunneling probabilities, requiring narrower barriers and/or lower heights to be significant.",
    "The condition 'quantum beats classical by 10x or more' is interpreted as instances where classical probability is 0 (due to E < V) and quantum probability is > 0. All non-zero tunneling results for E < V satisfy this.",
    "Lighter particles (electrons) exhibit substantially higher tunneling probabilities than heavier particles (protons, deuterons), as expected.",
    "Tunneling probability decreases exponentially with increasing barrier width and the square root of barrier height and particle mass."
