# Next Questions for Investigation

1.  **Impact of Particle Energy (E):** How do tunneling probabilities and the quantum vs. classical advantage change as the incident particle energy (E) approaches the barrier height (V)? Explore E values from 0.1 eV up to V.
2.  **Barrier Shape:** The current model assumes a square potential barrier. How would more realistic barrier shapes (e.g., parabolic, Eckart) affect tunneling rates?
3.  **Temperature Dependence:** How can temperature effects be incorporated into this model? (e.g., by considering a distribution of particle energies).
4.  **Multi-dimensional Tunneling:** Explore tunneling in 2D or 3D potentials.
5.  **Specific Enzyme Systems:** Apply the calculator to model specific enzymatic reactions known to involve tunneling, using parameters derived from literature or computational chemistry for those enzymes.
6.  **Kinetic Isotope Effects (KIEs):** Systematically calculate and compare tunneling rates for protons vs. deuterons (and tritons) to predict KIEs and compare with experimental data for enzymatic reactions.
7.  **Dynamic Barriers:** How do protein dynamics (fluctuations in barrier width and height) influence effective tunneling rates?
8.  **Sensitivity Analysis:** Perform a more detailed sensitivity analysis of tunneling probability with respect to each input parameter.
9.  **Visualization:** Develop scripts to visualize tunneling probability as a function of barrier width and height for different particles.
10. **Beyond WKB:** For which regimes does the WKB approximation (implicitly used here) break down, and would more exact solutions be needed?
