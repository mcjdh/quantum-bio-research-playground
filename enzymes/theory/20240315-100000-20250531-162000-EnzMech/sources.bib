@Comment{No specific literature was cited directly for the conceptual designs,
             as they are based on general principles of quantum tunneling in enzymes,
             protein structure, and computational chemistry methodologies.
             Future work involving specific enzyme modeling would require detailed citations.

             General concepts underpinning this work can be found in textbooks and reviews on:
             - Enzyme kinetics and mechanisms
             - Quantum mechanics in chemistry
             - Computational enzymology
             - Theories of hydrogen tunneling (e.g., Bell, Marcus, Kuznetsov)
