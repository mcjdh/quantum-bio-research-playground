    "Quantum tunneling probability for proton transfer can significantly exceed classical thermal activation probability across biological temperatures (270K-330K) for plausible energy barrier parameters (V0=0.3eV, L=0.4Ã…).",

  "surprising_results": [
    "The degree of dominance of quantum tunneling can be substantial (e.g., >10x to >100x) across the physiological temperature range for the chosen parameters, suggesting it's not a borderline effect under these conditions."
