    "A computational model simulating DNA evolution with classical mutations versus classical + quantum-inspired mutations (biased towards transitions) was developed.",
    "Under the tested parameters (sequence length 50, pop size 100, specific mutation rates, random target), the quantum-inspired mechanism, when added to classical mutations, resulted in slower adaptation and lower final fitness compared to classical mutations alone.",
    "The result suggests that the benefits of specific quantum mutation characteristics (like transition bias) can be outweighed by factors like increased overall mutation rate or non-optimal bias for a given fitness landscape."

    "The quantum-inspired mutation mechanism, as implemented by being additive to classical mutations and with a strong transition preference, consistently underperformed the classical-only mechanism, contrary to the initial hypothesis that it would provide an advantage."
