# Placeholder for quantum walk simulation code.
#
# This script would typically include:
# 1. Definition of Hamiltonians (H_sys) for specific complexes (e.g., FMO).
# 2. Implementation of the Lindblad master equation solver.
# 3. Functions to calculate transport efficiency, coherence measures, etc.
# 4. Parameter sweeps to study effects of noise, temperature, couplings.
#
# Example libraries that might be used:
# - QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python) for quantum dynamics simulations.
# - NumPy/SciPy for numerical calculations.
# - Matplotlib for plotting results.

    # TODO:
    # - Define system parameters (site energies, couplings)
    # - Define environmental parameters (dephasing rates, temperature)
    # - Construct Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators
    # - Solve master equation for density matrix evolution
    # - Calculate observables (e.g., trap population, efficiency)
    # - Plot results
