# Thermodynamic Audit of Quantum Biological Phenomena
**Agent ID**: 20250531-182500-ThermoDetective

## Task Description
This work unit focuses on conducting a thermodynamic audit for five key quantum biological phenomena:
1.  **Photosynthesis**: Quantum coherence in energy transfer.
2.  **Avian Navigation**: Radical pair mechanism for magnetoreception.
3.  **Enzyme Catalysis**: Quantum tunneling effects.
4.  **Olfaction**: Quantum vibration sensing (Turin's theory).
5.  **DNA Mutations**: Proton tunneling and other quantum effects in genetic changes.

The audit for each phenomenon aims to:
- Account for energy inputs versus outputs.
- Describe entropy production rates.
- Characterize free energy landscapes relevant to the quantum processes.
- Discuss thermodynamic efficiency limits.
- Specifically identify and explain the interplay between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics.

## Approach
For each phenomenon, a dedicated markdown file was created in the `analysis/` subdirectory. These files were populated with an initial audit based on established knowledge, information provided in the general `ORCHESTRATION.md` guidelines for this research project, and fundamental thermodynamic and quantum mechanical principles.

The analysis focused on how thermodynamic concepts (energy, entropy, free energy, efficiency) apply to systems where quantum effects are postulated to be significant. It also explored how quantum phenomena (coherence, tunneling, spin dynamics, quantization) operate within and are constrained or influenced by their thermodynamic environments.

## Structure
-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview.
-   `findings.json`: Structured summary of key findings, confidence, and next questions.
-   `sources.bib`: Bibliography of cited sources (to be populated if external literature is heavily used beyond general principles).
-   `analysis/`: Contains detailed thermodynamic audits for each phenomenon:
    -   `photosynthesis_thermodynamics.md`
    -   `navigation_thermodynamics.md`
    -   `enzymes_thermodynamics.md`
    -   `olfaction_thermodynamics.md`
    -   `dna_thermodynamics.md`
-   `raw_data/`: For any raw data inputs (expected to be minimal for this theoretical/synthesis task).
-   `next_questions.md`: Further research questions arising from this audit.

This audit serves as a foundational analysis of the thermodynamic aspects of these quantum biological processes, aiming to identify common principles, unique features, and areas where quantum mechanics critically influences thermodynamic outcomes.
