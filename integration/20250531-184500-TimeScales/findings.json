    "Mapped femtosecond-scale quantum coherence for enzymes (~96 fs), olfaction (~9 fs), photosynthesis (~960 fs), and DNA proton events (~960 fs).",
    "Associated nanosecond timescales with photosynthetic energy transfer and FRET, noting data for specific transfer times requires further detail.",
    "Linked millisecond timescales to macroscopic enzyme turnover rates, representing an outcome of faster quantum processes.",
    "Identified year-plus timescales for evolutionary adaptation driven by quantum-influenced mutations.",
    "Highlighted major temporal mismatches: e.g., fs quantum events impacting ms enzyme function or year-long evolutionary processes.",
    "Outlined crucial synchronization mechanisms: e.g., ps protein dynamics gating fs quantum events in enzymes, and Âµs radical pair signal integration for s-hrs behavioral responses in navigation.",
    "Recognized environment-quantum synchronization (e.g., ENAQT, specific phonon coupling) as a general principle in quantum biology."
  ],
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "confidence_rationale": "Confidence is 0.7 because the mapping relies on information from existing project documents (like decoherence_calculations.md) and established quantum biology concepts. Some specific timescales (e.g., for nanosecond energy transfer steps) were not precisely detailed in immediately available files, requiring more general statements. The analysis of mismatches and synchronization is based on logical interpretation of these timescales.",
  "surprising_results": [
    "The vast difference in scales (e.g., femtosecond quantum events to millisecond biological functions or year-long evolutionary outcomes) underscores the critical roles of amplification, integration, and hierarchical control in biological systems to translate quantum effects into macroscopic consequences."

  "contradicts": [],
  "supports": [],
  "next_priority": "Further investigate specific ns energy transfer pathways in photosynthesis by analyzing simulation data (e.g. from `photosynthesis/network_simulation/`). Quantitatively model key synchronization mechanisms, such as protein dynamics gating enzyme reactions or signal integration in magnetoreception."
