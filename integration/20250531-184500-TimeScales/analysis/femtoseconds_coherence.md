# Femtosecond Scale Coherence (1 fs = 10<sup>-15</sup> s)

This document outlines quantum coherence phenomena observed or predicted to occur within the femtosecond timescale. These are primarily related to the very initial stages of quantum processes in biological systems.

The decoherence times listed below are estimates. Mechanisms discussed in `coherence_extension_mechanisms.md` (if available) might explain how these short-lived coherences can still be biologically relevant.

## Enzyme-Related Coherence

*   **Estimated Decoherence Time:** ~96 fs.
*   **Source:** Decoherence estimates from `decoherence_calculations.md`.
*   **Description:** This refers to quantum coherence involved in enzymatic reactions, potentially related to proton or electron tunneling, or vibrational coupling during the catalytic process.

## Olfaction Electron Coherence

*   **Estimated Decoherence Time:** ~9.2 fs.
*   **Source:** Decoherence estimates from `decoherence_calculations.md`.
*   **Description:** Relates to the proposed quantum mechanisms in olfaction, where electron coherence might play a role in distinguishing odorant molecules.

## Photosynthesis Coherence

*   **Estimated Decoherence Time:** ~960 fs (0.96 ps).
*   **Source:** Decoherence estimates from `decoherence_calculations.md`.
*   **Description:** Coherence observed in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. This timescale is near the boundary of femtoseconds and picoseconds. It represents the duration over which quantum wavelike energy transfer can be maintained before classical hopping mechanisms become dominant.

## DNA Proton Coherence

*   **Estimated Decoherence Time:** ~960 fs (0.96 ps).
*   **Source:** Decoherence estimates from `decoherence_calculations.md`.
*   **Description:** This refers to the coherence of protons, particularly those involved in hydrogen bonds within DNA. Such coherence could be relevant for mutation rates (via proton tunneling) or other DNA dynamics. This timescale is also near the femtosecond/picosecond boundary.

## Notes and Assumptions

*   The decoherence times are highly dependent on the specific molecular environment and temperature.
*   The biological significance of such short coherence times is an active area of research, potentially relying on mechanisms that protect or regenerate coherence, or where even brief coherence offers a kinetic advantage.
*   The source document `decoherence_calculations.md` should be consulted for details on how these estimates were derived.
*   The document `coherence_extension_mechanisms.md` (if available) should be consulted for context on how these coherences might be functionally relevant.
