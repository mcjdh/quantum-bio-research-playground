## Mathematical Models for Quantum Coherence
- **System Hamiltonian**: `H_sys = Σ_i E_i |i⟩⟨i| + Σ_{{i!=j}} V_{{ij}} |i⟩⟨j|` (defines network of N chromophores with site energies E_i and couplings V_{{ij}}).
- **Open Quantum Systems**: Lindblad master equation for environmental interactions (dephasing, relaxation, trapping).
- **Quantum Walk Model**: Exciton movement on the network. Efficiency influenced by coherent transport, site energies, network topology.
- **Environment-Assisted Quantum Transport (ENAQT)**: Noise can enhance transport by suppressing localization, overcoming energy barriers, or tuning site energies. Optimal noise is non-zero.

## Testable Predictions (related to network/dynamics)
- Non-monotonic temperature dependence of efficiency (ENAQT).
- Isotope effects altering vibrational environment (noise spectral density) affecting coherence and efficiency.
- Engineered systems with varied couplings, site energies, environmental interactions to demonstrate and optimize ENAQT.
