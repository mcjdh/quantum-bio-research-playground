# Summary of Network Concepts in DNA (Proton Tunneling)

## Proton Transfer in Base Pairs
- Core: A 2-node system within a DNA base pair (e.g., between N-H donor and N or O acceptor in A-T or G-C pairs during tautomerization).
- Connection: The spatial pathway through which a proton tunnels from the donor atom to the acceptor atom.
- Function: Potential mechanism for spontaneous gene mutations. If a proton tunnels to form a rare tautomeric form of a base at the moment of DNA replication, it can lead to incorrect base pairing.
- Factors: Tunneling probability depends on the barrier height and width for proton transfer. Simulations suggest tunneling can dominate over classical thermal activation at physiological temperatures for plausible barrier parameters.
- Topology: Localized 2-node interactions within the larger DNA structure. Not a network for extended information flow between multiple distinct units in this context, but a site of quantum transition.
