# Summary of Network Concepts in Navigation

## Radical Pair Mechanism (RPM)
- Core: A 2-node quantum "network" consisting of a radical pair (two molecules with spin-correlated electrons).
- Connection: Quantum mechanical correlation (entanglement/coherence) between the spins of the two electrons.
- Function: Sensing the Earth's magnetic field. The magnetic field influences the interconversion rates between singlet and triplet spin states of the pair.
- Output: Different spin states lead to different chemical reaction products, which are then transduced into a neural signal.
- Key Challenge: Maintaining spin coherence for microsecond timescales in a noisy biological environment.
- Simulation: Models exist for 2-spin systems (e.g., `H = g1*mu_B*B*Sz1 + g2*mu_B*B*Sz2`) including dephasing. Sensitivity to magnetic fields is highly dependent on coherence lifetime.
- Topology: Essentially a single, quantum-connected dyad. Not a multi-node network in the classical sense.
