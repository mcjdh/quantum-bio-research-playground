# Summary of Network Concepts in Olfaction (Vibration Theory)

## Inelastic Electron Tunneling Model
- Core: A 3-component system or a type of "gated" network.
    - Node 1: Electron source within the olfactory receptor.
    - Node 2 (Gate): The odorant molecule bound to the receptor.
    - Node 3: Electron sink (or acceptor) within the olfactory receptor.
- Connection: An electron tunneling pathway from source to sink.
- Function: Smell perception. The theory suggests that if an odorant molecule, bound within the receptor, has vibrational modes whose energies match the energy difference between electron states in the source and sink (or across a tunneling junction), it promotes inelastic electron tunneling.
- Mechanism: The electron loses energy by exciting a vibrational mode in the odorant molecule as it tunnels. This inelastic process is proposed to be the recognition event.
- Topology: A very small, linear "source-gate-sink" arrangement. The "gate" (odorant) properties (its vibrational spectrum) determine the "conductivity" of the network for a given energy drop.
- Isotope Effects: Changes in odorant vibrational frequencies due to isotopic substitution (e.g., deuteration) are predicted to alter the tunneling probability and thus the perceived smell, which is a key piece of evidence for the theory.
