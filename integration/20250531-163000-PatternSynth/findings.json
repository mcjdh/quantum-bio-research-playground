    "Identified core quantum principles (coherence, entanglement, tunneling, radical pairs, ENAQT, Zeno effect, noise-induced coherence) potentially active in biological systems.",
    "Proposed that environmental noise in biological systems is not purely destructive and can play a constructive role (e.g., ENAQT, noise-induced coherence).",
    "Hypothesized that biological evolution may have selected for molecular architectures and dynamics that protect or even leverage quantum phenomena.",
    "Outlined potential for unifying quantum mechanisms across diverse biological phenomena (e.g., tunneling in enzymes and DNA; coherence in photosynthesis and potentially other transport processes).",
    "Stressed that robustness against decoherence is a primary filter for the biological relevance of any quantum principle."

    "The extent to which biological systems might not just passively protect quantum effects, but actively harness environmental noise for quantum advantage is a key emerging insight."

    "General premise of the Quantum Biology field as outlined in ORCHESTRATION.md, specifically the 'Integration Opportunities' section seeking common principles."
