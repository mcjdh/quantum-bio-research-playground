        "Vibrational Assistance and Quantum Zeno Effect were modeled as direct multipliers to decoherence time (factors of 1.5 and 2.0 respectively).",
        "Topology Optimization and Decoherence-Free Subspaces were modeled as reductions in environmental coupling strength (30% and 85% reduction respectively).",
        "Correlation with Environment was modeled by altering the temperature dependency of decoherence (rate proportional to T^0.5 instead of T).",
