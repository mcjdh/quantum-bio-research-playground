# Estimated Decoherence Times at Body Temperature (310.15 K)

This document outlines the estimation of decoherence times at human body temperature (37°C or 310.15 K) for various quantum biological phenomena.
Due to limitations in accessing specific literature values and parameters during this automated analysis, the following calculations rely on:
- Typical decoherence times reported in general literature (stated as assumptions).
- Plausible temperature scaling laws (e.g., 1/τ_d ∝ T or T^2) based on the nature of interaction with the thermal environment.

**All calculated values should be considered order-of-magnitude estimates.**

## 1. Photosynthesis (e.g., FMO complex)

*   **Assumed Reference Decoherence Time (τ_d_ref):** ~1 ps (picosecond) at T_ref = 298 K (room temperature).
    *   *Rationale:* Coherence in photosynthetic complexes is known to be short-lived, in the sub-picosecond to picosecond range at room temperature.
*   **Assumed Temperature Scaling:** 1/τ_d ∝ T (decoherence rate proportional to temperature).
    *   *Rationale:* Phonon-induced decoherence often exhibits linear scaling with T at physiological temperatures, especially for Ohmic-like spectral densities of the environment.
*   **Calculation:**
    τ_d_body = τ_d_ref * (T_ref / T_body)
    τ_d_body = 1 ps * (298 K / 310.15 K)
    τ_d_body ≈ 1 ps * 0.9608
    **τ_d_body ≈ 0.96 ps**

## 2. Navigation (Radical Pair Mechanism)

*   **Assumed Reference Decoherence Time (τ_d_ref):** ~1 µs (microsecond) at T_ref = 298 K.
    *   *Rationale:* Radical pair lifetimes need to be sufficiently long for geomagnetic field sensing, typically in the microsecond range. This is often limited by spin relaxation processes (T1, T2).
*   **Assumed Temperature Scaling:** 1/τ_d ∝ T.
    *   *Rationale:* Spin relaxation rates (like those from spin-phonon coupling or fluctuating local magnetic fields due to molecular motion) can scale linearly with temperature in many regimes.
*   **Calculation:**
    τ_d_body = τ_d_ref * (T_ref / T_body)
    τ_d_body = 1 µs * (298 K / 310.15 K)
    τ_d_body ≈ 1 µs * 0.9608
    **τ_d_body ≈ 0.96 µs**

## 3. Enzymes (Quantum Tunneling - related coherence)

*   **Concept:** For tunneling, "decoherence" might relate to the lifetime of a specific conformation or vibrational state enabling tunneling, or the phase coherence of the tunneling particle if modeled as a wave. This is less direct than qubit decoherence. We'll consider the stability of a quantum state facilitating the reaction.
*   **Assumed Reference "Effective Coherence" Time (τ_d_ref):** ~100 fs (femtoseconds) at T_ref = 298 K.
    *   *Rationale:* Vibrational modes and coherent nuclear motion relevant to promoting tunneling are typically very short-lived, on femtosecond timescales.
*   **Assumed Temperature Scaling:** 1/τ_d ∝ T.
    *   *Rationale:* Protein dynamics and vibrational relaxation rates often scale with temperature.
*   **Calculation:**
    τ_d_body = τ_d_ref * (T_ref / T_body)
    τ_d_body = 100 fs * (298 K / 310.15 K)
    τ_d_body ≈ 100 fs * 0.9608
    **τ_d_body ≈ 96 fs**

## 4. Olfaction (Quantum Vibration Sensing - electron coherence)

*   **Assumed Reference Decoherence Time (τ_d_ref):** ~10 fs (femtoseconds) for electron coherence during inelastic tunneling at T_ref = 298 K.
    *   *Rationale:* Electron transport through molecular junctions is very fast, and coherence is typically lost on femtosecond timescales due to strong interactions with molecular vibrations and the environment.
*   **Assumed Temperature Scaling:** 1/τ_d ∝ T^2.
    *   *Rationale:* Electron-phonon scattering rates in some systems can show a T^2 dependence, especially if two-phonon processes become significant or due to the density of thermally excited phonons. This is a stronger assumption.
*   **Calculation:**
    τ_d_body = τ_d_ref * (T_ref / T_body)^2
    τ_d_body = 10 fs * (298 K / 310.15 K)^2
    τ_d_body ≈ 10 fs * (0.9608)^2
    τ_d_body ≈ 10 fs * 0.9231
    **τ_d_body ≈ 9.2 fs**

## 5. DNA (Quantum Mutations - proton tunneling coherence)

*   **Assumed Reference Decoherence Time (τ_d_ref):** ~1 ps (picosecond) for proton coherence in a double-well potential (representing hydrogen bond) at T_ref = 298 K.
    *   *Rationale:* Protons are light, but the environment of DNA is dense and wet. Coherence of a proton superposition state would be subject to rapid dephasing from surrounding water and DNA vibrations.
*   **Assumed Temperature Scaling:** 1/τ_d ∝ T.
    *   *Rationale:* Similar to other vibrational decoherence mechanisms, a linear scaling with T is a common first approximation.
*   **Calculation:**
    τ_d_body = τ_d_ref * (T_ref / T_body)
    τ_d_body = 1 ps * (298 K / 310.15 K)
    τ_d_body ≈ 1 ps * 0.9608
    **τ_d_body ≈ 0.96 ps**

## Summary of Estimated Decoherence Times at Body Temperature (310.15 K)

*   **Photosynthesis:** ~0.96 ps
*   **Navigation (Radical Pair):** ~0.96 µs
*   **Enzymes (Tunneling-related):** ~96 fs
*   **Olfaction (Electron Coherence):** ~9.2 fs
*   **DNA (Proton Coherence):** ~0.96 ps

**Important Caveat:** These are rough estimates based on stated assumptions. Actual values can vary significantly based on the specific molecular system, environment, and the precise definition of decoherence.
