    "Quantum channels, bounded by the Holevo quantity, can offer higher information capacity (e.g., ~0.601 bits for example non-orthogonal states vs. <1 for classical on same states) compared to classical channels using similar resources, especially with non-orthogonal state encoding.",
    "Von Neumann entropy quantifies information in quantum states (0 for pure, >0 for mixed). Biological processes involving quantum state evolution will see entropy changes reflecting information flow and decoherence (e.g., hypothetical process showed ΔS ≈ 0.80 bits).",
    "Biological systems likely use principles analogous to quantum error correction (redundancy, repair, decoherence-free subspaces, Zeno effect) to achieve robustness, rather than formal QEC codes.",
    "Quantum-enhanced sensing (approaching Heisenberg Limit) can theoretically provide significantly higher precision (Δφ ~ 1/N vs 1/√N) and thus greater information bandwidth than classical sensors (e.g., for N=200 probes, HL gives ~8.64 bits vs SQL's ~4.82 bits).",
