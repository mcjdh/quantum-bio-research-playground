    "Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) provides a framework to model the emergence of quantum biological mechanisms by comparing their net fitness payoffs (benefits minus costs, including complexity and fragility) against classical alternatives.",
    "Quantum mechanisms can become Evolutionary Stable Strategies (ESS) if their advantages (e.g., increased efficiency, speed, sensitivity) significantly outweigh costs, particularly in specific environmental niches that selectively favor these quantum traits.",
    "The fragility of quantum states (decoherence) is a major cost; evolution likely selects for protective environments (e.g., protein pockets) or dedicated mechanisms (e.g., dynamic decoupling analogues, Environment-Assisted Quantum Transport - ENAQT) to ensure reliability.",
    "Environmental factors (temperature, light, substrate availability) are critical in determining the relative payoffs of quantum vs. classical strategies, leading to context-dependent evolutionary outcomes.",
    "The 'constructive use of noise' (e.g., ENAQT) represents a sophisticated evolutionary strategy where the environment is co-opted to enhance quantum effects, rather than just being a source of decoherence."
  ],
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "confidence_rationale": "The EGT framework is well-established. Application to quantum biology is conceptual but supported by qualitative analysis of existing project findings and literature. Quantitative validation for specific biological systems is needed for higher confidence.",
  "surprising_results": [
    "The most surprising insight is the potential for evolution to not just *protect* against environmental noise but to actively *harness* it (e.g., ENAQT) to create a quantum advantage, turning a liability into an asset."
