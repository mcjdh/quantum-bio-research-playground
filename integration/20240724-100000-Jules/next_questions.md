*   How can the decoherence model be refined to more accurately represent specific molecular sizes (e.g., actual small molecules vs. protein complexes) instead of an abstract size parameter?
*   What are more realistic coupling strengths/spectral densities for water, lipid membranes, and protein pockets?
*   How do specific quantum phenomena (e.g., radical pairs, excitons) interact with these environmental parameters to affect their specific decoherence pathways?
*   Can experimental data be found to validate or calibrate the simulation parameters for these environments?
*   Explore the impact of molecular geometry and specific chemical interactions on decoherence times within these environments.
*   Generate interactive visualizations or a wider range of plots to better explore the parameter space.
