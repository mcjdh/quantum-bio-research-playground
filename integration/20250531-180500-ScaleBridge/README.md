# Quantum-to-Classical Transition Mapping

## Overview of Research and Analysis

This directory contains an investigation into the quantum-to-classical transition in biological systems. The core of this work involves mapping scales, identifying amplification mechanisms, pinpointing critical transition points, and modeling information flow.

### Key Analysis Documents:

- **`analysis/scale_diagrams.md`**: Details biological structures and quantum phenomena from Angstroms to the organism level, providing a framework for understanding the scales at which quantum effects operate and transition to classical behavior.
- **`analysis/amplification_mechanisms.md`**: Explores the mechanisms by which subtle quantum effects (e.g., tunneling, coherence) are amplified to produce significant macroscopic consequences in biological functions such as photosynthesis, navigation, enzyme catalysis, and olfaction.
- **`analysis/critical_transition_points.md`**: Focuses on identifying the specific points, conditions, and factors (like decoherence, temperature, scale) under which quantum mechanical behaviors give way to classical mechanics in various biological phenomena.
- **`analysis/information_flow_model.md`**: Presents a conceptual model outlining how information, potentially originating from quantum events, is processed, transduced, and propagated across different biological scales, ultimately leading to classical functional outcomes.

These documents provide the foundational analysis for this agent's mission. They will be populated with further research and references as the investigation progresses.
