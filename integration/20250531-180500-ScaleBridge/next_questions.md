## Detailed Research Questions for Analysis Documents

### For `scale_diagrams.md`:
- What are the precise experimentally determined scales for key quantum phenomena (e.g., coherence length in FMO, lifetime of radical pairs in specific cryptochromes) under physiological conditions?
- How do environmental factors (e.g., temperature, pH, solvent viscosity, molecular crowding) quantitatively affect these characteristic scales?
- Can we create a visual (e.g., using Mermaid.js or similar markdown-friendly tools) multi-scale diagram that maps quantum phenomena onto specific biological structures and their typical dimensions?
- What are the smallest biological units where classical descriptions become predominantly sufficient, and what are the exceptions?

### For `amplification_mechanisms.md`:
- For each identified amplification mechanism (e.g., enzyme cascades, GPCR signaling), what is the quantitative gain or amplification factor from the initial quantum event to the macroscopic output?
- How robust are these amplification pathways to noise and environmental fluctuations? Are there error-correction or noise-filtering mechanisms involved?
- Are there common motifs or design principles in biological amplification strategies across different quantum phenomena?
- Can we identify specific molecular "switches" or "triggers" that are exquisitely sensitive to quantum events and initiate amplification?
- What are the energetic costs associated with these amplification mechanisms?

### For `critical_transition_points.md`:
- What are the measured decoherence times for key quantum states in vivo or in realistic in vitro environments for each phenomenon (photosynthesis, enzymes, etc.)?
- How do specific protective mechanisms (e.g., hydrophobic pockets, vibrational decoupling, quantum Zeno effect) quantitatively extend coherence or delay the quantum-to-classical transition?
- Can we develop more precise mathematical models or metrics to define the "degree of quantumness" at different stages of a biological process?
- Are there feedback loops where classical states at a larger scale can influence or stabilize quantum states at a smaller scale?
- What are the experimental signatures that would allow us to observe these transition points directly?

### For `information_flow_model.md`:
- How can information theory (e.g., Shannon entropy, mutual information) be applied to quantify information transfer across scales in these biological systems?
- What is the fidelity of information transfer at each stage of transduction (quantum -> molecular -> cellular -> organismal)?
- What are the bandwidth limitations for information flow in these quantum-biological pathways?
- Can we identify "information bottlenecks" where the system is most vulnerable to information loss?
- How is quantum information (e.g., phase, entanglement) ultimately converted into classical information that is robust and actionable for the organism?

## Broader Integration Questions
- Are there overarching principles that govern how biological systems harness quantum effects and manage the quantum-to-classical transition across all phenomena studied (photosynthesis, navigation, enzymes, olfaction, DNA)?
- Can we develop a unified mathematical framework or simulation approach to model these multi-scale quantum-to-classical processes in biology?
- What are the evolutionary pressures that might have selected for the specific quantum-to-classical pathways observed in nature?
- What new experimental techniques are needed to probe these interfaces and information flows more directly?
- What are the potential biotechnological or medical implications of understanding and potentially manipulating these quantum-to-classical transitions in biological systems?
