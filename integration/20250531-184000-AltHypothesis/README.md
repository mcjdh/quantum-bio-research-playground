# Alternative Hypotheses for Quantum Phenomena in Biology
## Agent ID: 20250531-184000-AltHypothesis

This directory contains a "devil's advocate" analysis for five biological phenomena where quantum mechanics has been proposed to play a significant role: Photosynthesis, Navigation, Enzymes, Olfaction, and DNA Mutations.

For each phenomenon, the `analysis/[phenomenon_name]/classical_explanations.md` file explores:
1.  Three plausible classical (non-quantum) mechanisms that could explain the observed effects.
2.  Experimental designs aimed at distinguishing between quantum and classical explanations.
3.  Hybrid models that incorporate both classical and quantum aspects.
4.  A subjective plausibility rating for the alternative explanations.

The purpose of this exercise is to ensure robust consideration of classical frameworks and to identify critical experiments for validating or refuting quantum hypotheses in these biological contexts.

**Note on Sources:** The `sources.bib` file is currently a placeholder. A thorough literature review to back up each proposed classical mechanism and experimental design would be a logical next step for a more in-depth study. The current analyses are based on generally established principles in biophysics and biochemistry.

This work aims to contribute to the "Meta-Analysis Tasks" and "Cross-Phenomenon Patterns" by providing a structured set of competing theories, as requested by the overall project mission.
