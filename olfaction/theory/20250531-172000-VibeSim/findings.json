    "Successfully implemented a Simple Harmonic Oscillator model to calculate vibrational frequencies for specified bonds in odorant molecules.",
    "Calculated frequencies for 50+ odorant entries, focusing on O-H, C=O, C-H, N-H, and S-H bonds.",
    "Demonstrated isotopic shift calculations (H vs. D), showing expected frequency ratio of ~1.35-1.4 for X-H vs X-D bonds.",
    "Typical O-H stretch frequencies calculated: ~3000-3700 cm^-1.",

    "While expected, the consistency of the H/D isotopic frequency ratio across different X-H bond types (O-H, C-H, N-H, S-H) reinforces the mass-dependency of the vibration.",
    "The diversity of molecules sharing common smell categories (e.g., 'fruity') despite having different primary vibrating bonds (e.g. C=O in esters, O-H in some fruity alcohols) suggests that single bond vibrations are only part of the story, or that multiple vibrational modes contribute to a perceived smell."
