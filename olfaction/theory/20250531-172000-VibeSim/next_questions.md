# Next Research Questions for Olfaction Vibration Analysis

1.  **Statistical Correlation**:
    *   What are the statistically significant correlations between specific vibrational frequencies (or H/D frequency shifts) and narrowly defined smell categories from the generated dataset?
    *   Can machine learning models be trained on this (expanded) dataset to predict smell categories from vibrational spectra?

2.  **Refining the Model**:
    *   How would incorporating anharmonicity (going beyond the Simple Harmonic Oscillator model) affect the calculated frequencies and potential correlations?
    *   How significant is the influence of the molecular environment (e.g., receptor pocket) on the vibrational frequencies of odorants?
    *   Instead of single characteristic bonds, how would analyzing the full vibrational spectrum (e.g., from DFT calculations) for each molecule improve smell-category correlations?

3.  **Expanding the Dataset**:
    *   How do these correlations hold up if the dataset is expanded to include a wider range of molecules, including those with more complex structures or less common heteroatoms?
    *   Can we find minimal pairs of molecules (isomers or closely related structures) that have very different smells but similar vibrational spectra (or vice-versa) to test the limits of the vibrational theory?

4.  **Experimental Validation**:
    *   What are the most critical experimental tests (e.g., using deuterated odorants in psychophysical experiments) that could further validate or challenge the findings based on these theoretical calculations?
    *   How well do the calculated SHO frequencies match experimental IR/Raman data for the selected bonds in these odorant molecules?

5.  **Beyond Single Bonds**:
    *   How do combinations of vibrations (e.g., a C=O stretch and an O-H bend) contribute to a perceived smell? Are there "chords" of vibrations that define certain smell categories?
    *   Could low-frequency vibrational modes (e.g., torsional modes, whole-molecule vibrations) also play a role in olfaction, and how would they be modeled?
