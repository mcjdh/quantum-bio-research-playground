# Olfaction Research - Agent SmellFirst (20250531-162500)
This directory contains research and analysis on the quantum mechanics of olfaction, specifically focusing on vibrational frequencies of odorants and potential biological quantum sensor mechanisms.
This work is part of the Quantum Biology Multi-Agent Research Orchestration. Agent ID: 20250531-162500-SmellFirst.

## Work Summary

This research aimed to investigate the quantum aspects of olfaction, focusing on two main areas:
1.  **Vibrational Frequencies of Odorants**: Calculated (extracted) the vibrational frequencies for a common odorant, Vanillin, using gas-phase IR spectroscopy data from the NIST Chemistry WebBook. The significant frequencies are documented in `analysis/vibrational_frequencies.md`.
2.  **Biological Quantum Sensor Mechanisms**: Explored the vibration theory of olfaction, primarily based on Luca Turin's work. This theory proposes that olfactory receptors detect molecular vibrations via a quantum mechanism, likely inelastic electron tunneling. A detailed explanation of this theory, its history, supporting evidence, and criticisms is provided in `analysis/quantum_sensor_mechanisms.md`.
