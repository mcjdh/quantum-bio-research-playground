# Radical Pair Spin Dynamics Simulation for Avian Magnetoreception

**Agent ID:** 20250531-171500-SpinSim
**Phenomenon:** Navigation (Radical Pair Mechanism)
**Task Type:** Theory Development & Simulation

## 1. Introduction

This project simulates the spin dynamics of a radical pair, a key theoretical model for avian magnetoreception. The goal was to:
- Model a two-spin system starting in an entangled state.
- Include the effects of an Earth-strength magnetic field.
- Incorporate realistic decoherence.
- Map the trade-off between quantum coherence lifetime and magnetic field sensitivity.
- Identify parameter regimes potentially relevant for magnetoreception in birds.

The simulation was implemented in Python using the QuTiP library.

## 2. Simulation Setup

### System
- **Spins:** Two spin-1/2 particles (electrons).
- **Initial State:** Singlet state `(|up,down> - |down,up>) / sqrt(2)`.
- **Hamiltonian:**
    - Zeeman interaction with an external magnetic field `B`. The field was nominally set to 50 µT (Earth strength).
    - `H = g1 * mu_B * B * Sz1 + g2 * mu_B * B * Sz2`
    - Slightly different g-factors were used for the two spins (g1 = 2.0023, g2 = 2.0000) to drive singlet-triplet mixing.
    - Exchange interaction J was assumed to be zero (distant radicals).
- **Decoherence:** Modeled using collapse operators representing dephasing on each spin: `C1 = sqrt(gamma) * Sz1`, `C2 = sqrt(gamma) * Sz2`. The decoherence rate `gamma` was varied.
- **Observable:** Average singlet yield, `P_S(t)`, over the simulation time.

### Parameters Explored
- **Decoherence Rate (`gamma`):** Varied from 0.01 MHz to 100 MHz. This corresponds to characteristic spin coherence lifetimes (`tau = 1/gamma`) from 100 µs down to 10 ns.
- **Magnetic Field (for sensitivity):** A baseline field `B0 = 50 µT` and a perturbed field `B0 + dB` (with `dB = 1 µT`) were used to calculate sensitivity.
- **Simulation Time:** Adapted based on `gamma`, typically `5/gamma` or a fixed maximum of 10 µs.

## 3. Methodology

The simulation script (`analysis/spin_simulation.py`) performs the following steps:
1. Defines the spin system, Hamiltonian, and collapse operators using QuTiP.
2. For a range of `gamma` values:
    a. Calculates the characteristic lifetime `tau = 1/gamma`.
    b. Simulates the spin dynamics using `qutip.mesolve` under the baseline magnetic field `B0` and calculates the average singlet yield.
    c. Simulates again under the perturbed field `B0 + dB` and calculates the new average singlet yield.
    d. Computes sensitivity as `abs(Yield(B0+dB) - Yield(B0)) / dB`.
3. Saves the `(tau, sensitivity)` data to `raw_data/sensitivity_data.csv`.
4. Generates a log-log plot of sensitivity vs. lifetime, saved as `analysis/sensitivity_vs_lifetime.png`.

## 4. Key Findings

- **Sensitivity-Lifetime Trade-off:** The simulation clearly demonstrates that magnetic field sensitivity is strongly dependent on the coherence lifetime of the radical pair. Longer lifetimes (lower decoherence rates) lead to significantly higher sensitivities. This is visible in the `analysis/sensitivity_vs_lifetime.png` plot and the `raw_data/sensitivity_data.csv` file.
- **Biologically Plausible Regimes:**
    - For lifetimes commonly associated with biological radical pairs (1-10 µs), the calculated sensitivities (change in singlet yield per µT change in magnetic field) are very small, typically in the range of `10^-8` to `10^-10` Yield/µT.
    - For example, at a lifetime of ~1 µs, sensitivity is around `5e-10 Yield/µT`. At ~10 µs, it's around `2.5e-08 Yield/µT`.
- **Implications for Avian Magnetoreception:**
    - The small magnitude of the calculated sensitivity underscores the challenge for a biological system to detect such minute changes.
    - This suggests that if the radical pair mechanism is indeed the basis for avian magnetoreception, there must be sophisticated biological mechanisms for:
        1.  **Decoherence Protection:** Shielding the quantum coherence of the radical pair from environmental noise to achieve longer lifetimes.
        2.  **Signal Amplification:** Significantly amplifying the small initial change in spin state populations into a robust neurological signal.
- **Model Simplifications:** The current model uses a generic dephasing mechanism. Actual biological systems involve specific hyperfine interactions which are crucial for anisotropic (directional) sensitivity and could influence coherence in complex ways. These were not included in this initial model.

## 5. Conclusion

This simulation provides a basic model of radical pair spin dynamics and highlights the critical role of coherence lifetime in determining magnetic field sensitivity. While the model supports the feasibility of the radical pair mechanism in principle, it also emphasizes that the "quantum" aspect (long coherence) is paramount and likely requires specialized biological adaptations to function effectively in a noisy biological environment. The results point to the need for further investigation into specific molecular systems (like cryptochromes) and the mechanisms they might employ for coherence protection and signal amplification.
