    "Magnetic field sensitivity of a radical pair is strongly dependent on its coherence lifetime; longer lifetimes lead to higher sensitivity.",
    "For coherence lifetimes of 1-10 microseconds (plausible for biological systems), simulated magnetic field sensitivities are very small (e.g., 10^-8 to 10^-10 change in singlet yield per microtesla).",
    "The small calculated sensitivities suggest that effective biological magnetoreception via radical pairs would require robust mechanisms for decoherence protection and significant signal amplification.",
    "The model used generic dephasing; actual hyperfine interactions, crucial for anisotropy and potentially coherence, were not included in this initial simulation."
